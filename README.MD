# WORDBANK
WordBank is a non-interactive console project at the moment
This means its 'view' is the console.

## To get this running:
You need to make sure the database and table are set properly.
#### Run the sql/wordbank.sql file.
###### Through the command line:
- Go to the project directory
- Log in to mysql
- Type: `source sql/wordbank.sql` 

After this, you should be able to see the database when you type `SHOW DATABASES;`, and the table when you type `USE wordbank; SHOW TABLES;`;
