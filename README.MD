# WORDBANK
This is a small Java Web Application developed for the (Java Web Application Development I)[http://www.collin.edu/ce/courses/java_web_app_i_ii.html] course from Collin College.

The course teached how to design and develop dynamic web sites using Java technologies. Content convered included Java Servlets and JavaServer Pages, basic database connectivity using the Java JDBC API and how to install, configure and administer a basic Java application server.

## To get this running:
You need to make sure the database and table are set properly.
#### Run the sql/wordbank.sql file.
###### Through the command line:
- Go to the project directory
- Log in to mysql
- Type: `source sql/wordbank.sql` 

After this, you should be able to see the database when you type `SHOW DATABASES;`, and the table when you type `USE wordbank; SHOW TABLES;`;
