# WORDBANK
Is a Java Web Application that allows the user to manage a list of words pairings (from a language to another).

## To get this running:
Make sure the database and table are set properly:

#### Run the sql/wordbank.sql file.
###### Through the command line:
- Go to the project directory
- Log in to mysql
- Type: `source sql/wordbank.sql` 

After this, you should be able to see the database when you type `SHOW DATABASES;`, and the 3 tables when you type `USE wordbank; SHOW TABLES;`;
